    <h2><p>Different Foods Types and Their Benifits.</p></h2>
    <li><p><h3>Vegetables</h3><p/></li>
    <p> Parents always recommend you to consume your vegetables. they were right! vegetables provide you with potassium, dietary fiber, folate, vitamin A, and vitamin C. These are valuable resources that help maintain your bodily functions.</p>

    <li><p><h3>Meats</h3><p/></li>
    <p> Meats are the majority of people's favorite food, some choose veganism over it. Meat gives your body iodine, iron, zinc, vitamins (especially B12) and essential fatty acids.</p>

    <p> Those are the main two classes for healthy diet, allowing for subclasses to form. These classes are deviations of vegetables and meats</p>

    <li><p><h3>Dairy</h3><p/></li>
    <p> Dairy provides you calcium allowing for your bones to become much stronger. Dairy is most commonly farmed from livestock like cows.</p>

    <li><p><h3> Grain</h3><p/></li>
    <p>grain is the cousin of vegetables giving birth to the world wide common product, which is bread. This provides you iodine, iron, zinc, vitamins (especially B12) and essential fatty acids.</p>

    <li><p><h3>Fats</h3><p/></li>
    <p>Fats are the cousins of meats and they are a big necessity in your diet. Fats are nutrients in food that the body uses to build cell membranes, nerve tissue (including the brain), and hormones. The body also uses fat as fuel. If fats eaten aren't burned as energy or used as building blocks, they're stored by the body in fat cells.</p>

    <li><p><h3>Honorable Mentions</h3><p/></li>
    <p><h4>Water</h4><p/>
    <p>Water forms the basis of blood, digestive juices, urine and perspiration, and is contained in lean muscle, fat and bones. As the body can't store water, we need fresh supplies every day to make up for losses from the lungs, skin, urine and feces (poo).</p>
